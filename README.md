# github-api-study-case

This project is a POC for consuming the public github API.

It contains both a client and a server.

## How to run
Make sure you have <b>Node.js</b> and <b>yarn</b> installed in your computer. If you are on a UNIX machine, you can give the file "install-dependencies.sh" permission to run and start it
using ```./install-dependencies.sh``` or ```sh install-dependencies.sh```. If you are not in a UNIX computer you need to manually install the requirements by entering in each folder and using the command ```yarn install```.

After installing the dependencies run ```yarn start``` in the root folder and it will start both servers.
